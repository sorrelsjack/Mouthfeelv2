# Mouthfeelv2

Mouthfeel is a React Native project that allows users to document the gustatory experience of eating a certain food. This includes its texture, flavor, and any miscellaneous attributes. The food's mouthfeel, if you will.

The target audience includes those suffering from Avoidant / Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), autistic people, people with Sensory Processing Disorder, and anyone else who might have food aversions. Of course, those without food aversions are welcome to use the app as well, and are encouraged to, as they'd be most knowledgeable about food!

The app has a companion repo for its backend, which you can find here: https://github.com/sorrelsjack/MouthfeelAPIv2

I've neglected to take many screenshots or gifs of the app, but here are the few that I do have. The UI is likely to change, as I'm not a designer, but do have a designer friend who has offered to help me.
